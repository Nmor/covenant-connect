6. System Architecture
Folder Structure
/src
 /components          // Reusable UI components
 /hooks               // Custom hooks for business logic
 /lib
   /firebase.ts       // Firebase initialization
   /datasources       // Abstracted Firebase and API calls
     /prayerService.ts  // Handles prayer requests
     /eventService.ts   // Manages events data
     /donationService.ts // Handles donations and transactions
 /pages               // React page components
 /store               // Zustand stores for state management
 /styles              // CSS modules or TailwindCSS styles
 /types               // TypeScript interfaces for events, donations, etc.
 /config              // Configuration files (e.g., Firebase settings)




7. Data Sources (Abstraction Layer)
Prayer Request (prayerService.ts)
Submit Prayer Request: submitRequest(data: PrayerRequest)
Get All Requests: getAllRequests()
Events (eventService.ts)
Get Upcoming Events: getUpcomingEvents()
Get Events Calendar: getEventsCalendar()
Donations (donationService.ts)
Initialize Payment: initializePaystackPayment(data: DonationData)
Verify Payment: verifyPayment(reference: string)

8. State Management with Zustand
Global State Store
Prayer Store: Manage prayer requests data.
Event Store: Handle events calendar and event data.
Donation Store: Store and manage donation-related state.







Zustand Example (Prayer Store)
// store/usePrayerStore.ts
import { create } from 'zustand';


interface PrayerState {
 requests: PrayerRequest[];
 addRequest: (request: PrayerRequest) => void;
}


export const usePrayerStore = create<PrayerState>((set) => ({
 requests: [],
 addRequest: (request) =>
   set((state) => ({ requests: [...state.requests, request] })),
}));




9. Key Considerations for Development
Separation of Concerns:
UI components focus on presentation, not logic.
Business logic resides in services and hooks.
Type Safety:
Use TypeScript for improved maintainability.
Scalability:
Abstract Firebase calls to datasources for easy extension.
Testing:
Write unit tests for key services (e.g., donationService, prayerService).

10. Deployment & Hosting
Hosting: Vercel Hosting for frontend and backend.
Authentication: Firebase Auth for admin access.
Database: Firebase Firestore to store data.
CDN: Firebase for fast media content delivery.

11. Security Considerations
Authentication: Use Firebase Auth to secure admin access.
Payment Security: Implement tokenized payments using Paystack/Fincra.
Data Encryption: Secure user submissions (e.g., prayer requests) with encryption.

12. Conclusion
This technical requirements document outlines the structure, technologies, and features necessary to build the church website. With a clean and scalable architecture leveraging Vite+React, Firebase, and Zustand, the platform will deliver an engaging experience for church members and visitors.
